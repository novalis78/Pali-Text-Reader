	<h2 align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Background story:</font></h2>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Pali is an ancient middle Indian language, 
	either being Buddha's own mother tongue or at least a language closely 
	related to the Blessed Ones own language. For over 2500 years Buddhist 
	tradition handed down a vast amount of scriptures all written in Pali, which 
	contains the accumulated wisdom of the Buddhist teaching.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">During the 90's, in a joint effort, the Pali Canon 
	literature (containing several thousand pages) was digitized and published 
	by the VRI, a none profit organisation. Their CDROM, the &quot;Chattha Sangayana 
	CDROM&quot; or CSCD has been since one of the foremost tools when studying the 
	source of Buddhist teaching. However, the software which handled reading and 
	studying the volumes quite well, is not open source. On the contrary, the 
	Pali Text Reader is based on a plugin framework inviting users to improve 
	and customize the reader to their needs. Besides, 
	being written in C# its developers hope to port it soon to Linux/Unix and 
	Macintosh...</font></p>
