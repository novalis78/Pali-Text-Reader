Unfortunatly sourceforge does not allow large files in its svn
repository. 

So in this directory there should be at least the

>>pi.dict<<

file, which is missing, but which you can either separatly download from here:

http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/palireader/pi.dict?download


You can download also the latest Pali Text REader binary and copy it in here manually.
