The Pali Text Reader software is a reader for Pali texts. It provides in depth search (both throughout the tipitaka or single files), a dictionary and an (machine based) automatic Pali - English translator. The Pali Text Reader comes along with a library, containg all Tipitaka books compressed in a zip archive. Thus, you can read, search and study the Buddhist Canon wherever you are - it comes in two flavors: an online edition (3MB) and an extended edition with all resources (Tipitaka) which is approximately 70MB in size.
